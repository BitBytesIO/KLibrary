Collection of Shaders in Blender

This blender addon aims to create a diverse collection of shaders that have been contributed by various creators. This will provide artists with extensive access to a wide variety of shaders that can be used in their scenes, allowing for greater creativity and customization options.↵Currently, I have added 10 anime shaders which are fully customizable according to your specific requirements.
